## Box Cox Transformation

The box cox transformation is a parametrized transformation that tries to get distributions "as close to a normal distribution as possible"
It is defined as:

$$ \text{boxcox}(y_i) = \frac{y_i^{\lambda} - 1}{\lambda} $$

You can think of it as a generalization of the square root function: the square root function uses the exponent of 0.5, but box cox lets its exponent vary so it can find the best one.
